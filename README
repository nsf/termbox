Termbox is a library that provides minimalistic API which allows the
programmer to write text-based user interfaces.

TODO: better intro.

CHANGES
=======

v1.0.0:
- Remove the Go directory. People generally know about termbox-go and where
  to look for it.
- Remove old terminfo-related python scripts and backport the new one from
  termbox-go.
- Remove cmake/make-based build scripts, use waf.
- Add a simple terminfo database parser. Now termbox prefers using the
  terminfo database if it can be found. Otherwise it still has a fallback
  built-in database for most popular terminals.
- Some internal code cleanups and refactorings. The most important change is
  that termbox doesn't leak meaningless exported symbols like 'keys' and
  'funcs' now. Only the ones that have 'tb_' as a prefix are being exported.
- API: Remove unsigned ints, use plain ints instead.
- API: Rename UTF-8 functions 'utf8_*' -> 'tb_utf8_*'.
- API: TB_DEFAULT equals 0 now, it means you can use attributes alones
  assuming the default color.
- API: Add TB_REVERSE.
- API: Add TB_INPUT_CURRENT.
- Move python module to its own directory and update it due to changes in the
  termbox library.



INSTALLATION
============

Termbox comes with a waf-based build scripts. In order to configure, build and
install it, do the following:

  ./waf configure --prefix=/usr                                (configure)
  ./waf                                                        (build)
  ./waf install --destdir=DESTDIR                              (install)

By default termbox will install the header file and both shared and static
libraries. If you want to install a shared library or static library alone, use
the following as an install command:

  ./waf install --targets=termbox_shared --destdir=PREFIX      (shared library)
or
  ./waf install --targets=termbox_static --destdir=PREFIX      (static library)


PYTHON
------

In order to install the python module, use the following command (as root or
via sudo):

  python setup.py install

for Python 3:
  
  python3 setup.py install
